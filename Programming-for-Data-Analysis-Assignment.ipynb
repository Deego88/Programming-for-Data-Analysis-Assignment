    "Numpy’s random number routines produces pseudo random numbers using combinations of a **BitGenerator** to create sequences and a **Generator** to use those sequences to sample from different statistical distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **random bit generator** is a system whose output consists of fully unpredictable (i.e., statistically independent and unbiased) bits. In security applications, the unpredictability of the output implies that the generator must be also not observable and not manipulable by any attacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random bit generator basically differs with respect to a  pseudorandom number generator, because the complete knowledge of the generator structure and of whatever previously generated sequence does not result in any knowledge of any other bit. This means that the entropy of a sequence of n output bits should be ideally equal to n. On the contrary, the entropy of a sequence of n output bits of a pseudorandom generator cannot be greater than its seed, whatever n is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since pseudorandom generators are suitable in those applications where just a flat statistic is needed, random generators are suitable in applications where unpredictability is also needed. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Generator** provides access to a wide range of distributions. The Generator relies on an additional BitGenerator to manage state and generate the random bits, which are then transformed into random values from useful distributions. The default BitGenerator used by Generator is PCG64. The BitGenerator can be changed by passing an instantized BitGenerator to Generator.\n",
