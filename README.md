# Programming for Data Analysis 2020 Project
## G00387896 Richard Deegan

## Introduction

This analysis of the numpy.random package as part of the for Python has been carried out as an assignment of the Programming for Data Analysis module of the Higher Diploma In Data Analytics at GMIT. The project description can be found [here](https://github.com/Deego88/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Assignment/blob/master/Assignment%20images/ProgDA_Assignment.pdf).

The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores aspects of the numpy.random package in detail. The repository also includes:
* Readme file
* License file
* Gitignore folder
* Several images

### Downloading the Repository

The repository is stored [here](https://github.com/Deego88/Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Assignment).

To download it, do the following:

1. Click on the "Clone or Download" button.
2. Select "Download ZIP". This will open a prompt allowing you to save the file to your computer.
3. Navigate to the download location and extract the compressed (.zip) folder to a suitable location.

### Software Required

The notebook has been written using Jupyter Lab v2.2.6. and Python v3.8.6 and should be run on a computer with these versions or higher if possible. I recommend that you download the current Python 3.x Anaconda Distribution (which contains both Python and Jupyter Lab) from the [downloads section](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) of the Anaconda Website.

When it has downloaded, follow the installation steps with the default options to install Anaconda on your computer.

You can check which (if any) versions of these that you have installed by typing the following at the command prompt:
* python --version
* jupyter --version

This project also requires a number of external Python libraries ([listed below](#Libraries-Used)). These come with the Anaconda Distribution and should not need to be installed separately.

### Libraries Used

- Numpy
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Seaborn

Please note that the programmes will not run successfuly if their required libraries are not installed.

### How to Run

Once the correct software has been installed, running either of the included programmes can be carried out as follows:

1. Open a command prompt (cmd) or equivalent on your PC.
2. Navigate to the drive that the folder is on.
3. Navigate to the correct folder.
4. Run jupyter notebook by typing the following at the command prompt (do not close the command prompt window throughout):
> jupyter notebook

5. A window or tab should open in your default web browser (Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome are recommended). If this does not happen, read the command prompt output. It should provide a URL which you can copy and paste into your web browser to access Jupyter Notebook.
6. Using the menu on the left side of the page, double click the jupyter notebook file:
> Progamming-for-data-Analsys-Assignment.ipynb

7. The notebook should open in a new tab. You can run each cell with the keyboard shortcut SHIFT+ENTER, alternatively use the "play" button on the menu bar. Please note that certain cells must be run before others e.g. the cells importing the various Python libraries. You may find it convenient to use the "Run all Cells" option in the "Run" dropdown menu.
